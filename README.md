# ChromeBackgroundExtension
Easily download photos to a specified folder

# About the Extension
I have a folders of photos that contain various backgrounds that are cycled through for my computer.  
Using this extension when I come across a photo I want to add, I right-click and select "Add to Background Displays" and the photo gets downloaded directly to that folder

# Location
This downloads them to a folder called ~/Downloads/Backgrounds/
The location can be modified in the js code but it has to be relative to the Downloads directory.

# Example
Refer to the screenshot to see how it looks.  The 7th line now contains "Add to Background Displays" which when clicked will save the image directly to the folder.

The image is now part of your background photos!
